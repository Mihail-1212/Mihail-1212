# Mihail Mokruschin

👋 Hi, my name is @Mihail-1212. \
💻 I like programming. I... really like programming. \
⌨ There's just something about it. I like coding, thinking about code, doing code... review. \
🌱 I like to be satisfied with the well-builded project-layout. \
💞️ I like it when I have no compiling problem. \
📫 Feeling the heat of the keyboard at my fingertips.  \
✨ I like- Oh I'm sorry, I got myself all worked up. \
❔ Would you like to help me with my programming knowledge?
